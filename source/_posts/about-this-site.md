This site uses [Hexo](http://zespia.tw/hexo/) as its
blogging engine. I intended to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org) at first
but I ran into grief with syntax highlighting for code while testing. Pygments
the highlighting library used seems to be unable to parse the language argument
in the code block. I tried to sort it out but since I don't know too much about
Ruby and I wanted this site up within the day I switched to Hexo. It is very
similar to Octopress but uses nodejs and connect with ejs for its templates
instead of rails and erb. At least I should be able to fix things if they don't
work now, however it has been pretty smooth so far. Posts are written in
markdown.

It might be fun to write about miscellaneous technicalities as I run into them,
or I might not bother. It has certainly been useful to me to read the multitude
of little articles people have been putting up on their blogs, but I don't know
if I should be adding to them. We will see...
