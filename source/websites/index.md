I am a developer, not a designer, however I try to make a site look as pleasing
as possible. My starting point is a template, which I tweak and adapt till it
comes accross as some kind of unit, the exception so far has been the greenglass
site, which is actually bit more of a one page app then a traditional website.

Built with Drupal and hosted very cheaply at
[nearlyfreespeech](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net). The end user can build
their own galleries and add them to the site. Fully responsive, so mobile ready.

Built with angularjs and bootstrap and running off a
[home spun](https://github.com/Michieljoris/bb-server) nodejs server. The site
is built out of html fragments put together by my
[html-builder](https://github.com/Michieljoris/html-builder). Mobile
ready. Served from nodejitsu originally, but now from a Linode server. End user
is able to edit the main texts by using my
[dropbox editor](http://dbeditor.axion5.net/), and then visiting the sync page
on their site. The site automatically rebuilds itself after. Similarly the end
user can edit a list of videos. They get grouped automatically and listed on the
resources page. A bit similar to a blogging engine. In fact, using the same
mechanism the site can easily be expanded to enable dynamic adding/editing of
content, using an online editor. However, that is not implemented yet.

A true one page app using angularjs and nodejs. The idea was to make a site that
resembles a gallery as closely as possible. You can make a selection of the kind
of terrarium by clicking the select button. The site uses
[isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) for the auto rearranging images. End
user is able to upload images from an ipad to dropbox. By visiting the sync page
the server pulls these images from there. The end user is then able to add tags
such as price and size to all images. The end user has to log into the site to
enable the editing features. The server is again my own
[bb-server](https://github.com/Michieljoris/bb-server)), running on [AWS]() at the
moment but will migrate to a Linode server.
