I put this site together as a place to showcase the various websites and
projects I've done, and to perhaps publish what I think might be useful for
others to read.

If you are interested in contracting me to build a website for you, please head
over to [websites](/websites) where I've listed the sites I've done so far and a
little info on how it was done.

On the [projects](/projects) page I've listed a few of my more elaborate or
interesting software projects I've done so far. The source code for these and
others is up on [github](http://github.com/michieljoris).

If you're interested in me personally please check out the [about](/about)
page. For more detailed background on me please checkout either
[linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michieljoris) or
[careers.stackoverflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/michieljoris).
