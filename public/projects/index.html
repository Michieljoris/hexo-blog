<h3 id="bb-server"><a href="http://github.com/Michieljoris/bb-server">bb-server</a></h3>
<p>Starting out as cobbled together one page node server, it grew over the past<br>year to a more featured server. Totally rewritten and refactored a couple of<br>times, it now can function as a https server, and a socket server as well.<br>Customized logging, caching in memory and disk, and on the fly transpiling,<br>minifying and compressing of assets and more have turned it into a more<br>production ready server. </p>
<p>At the same time it still starts up with a single word command, all the features<br>are then disabled by default. A lot of features can still be enabled on that<br>same command line, but for an easier and more complete configuration a config<br>file can be used. No plugin system, since it is easier to just write it into the<br>server than designing one, except for the transpilers, compressors etc, more can<br>easily be added by using little api.</p>
<p>Mostly a learning experience for me, however I do use it for some of my sites. </p>

<h3 id="html-builder"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/html-builder">html-builder</a></h3>
<p>A simple html build system using templates of sort. Using<br><a href="https://github.com/flatiron/plates">flatiron plates</a> to fish out markers from<br>the html soup and a javascript object to knit it all together again. But again,<br>because I wrote it myself I can adapt it easily to whatever I need it to be, and<br>you learn a lot while writing and adapting it.<br><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/dbeditor">dbeditor</a></p>
<p>Dbeditor allows you to connect to your dropbox, browse the contents and then<br>edit text files using a markdown or wysiwyg editor.</p>

<h3 id="cachejs"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/cachejs">cachejs</a></h3>
<p>Implementation of both LRU and ARC cache. Used in bb-server. It includes a<br>heavily commented arc_cache.js file. The Adaptive Replacement Cache algorithm is<br>supposed be efficient. I think I understand how it works, but whether I could<br>have written it I don’t know. It seems clever.</p>

<h3 id="quilt"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/quilt">quilt</a></h3>
<p>A word play on futon, the database manager that comes with CouchDB. I thought it<br>was not as useful as it could be, so I wrote my own version. It allows you to<br>edit the various design docs in the manager. It also simplifies editing and<br>enabling replications, and a number of other enhancements. As usual I start out<br>with big plans for an app, and implement the bulk of it, but there definitly<br>still things that could be worked on and expanded on. </p>
<p>The other half of this app is a wizard to make it very easy for people to<br>install and cors enable a CouchDB database for use with an other web app,<br>roster. It then initializes the database depending on who they are and what<br>their preferences are, setting up the right replications and permissions.</p>

<h3 id="validate_doc_update"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/validate_doc_update">validate_doc_update</a></h3>
<p>Used for the roster web app to easily manage read -and- write permissions. I<br>didn’t want to write a different validate_doc_update document for every use<br>case, so I made a generic one that can be controlled via a little dsl, embedded<br>in the read permissions. See the github repo for more info.</p>

<h3 id="roster"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/roster">roster</a></h3>
<p>I’ve been doing shift work to make ends meet for a number of years. I got tired<br>of filling in time sheets, I never seemed to do that without at least one<br>mistake or correction, so I made a little Excel worksheet for my own use. This<br>time sheet was picked up by other staff and management and it had to be adapted<br>to other work places. In the end Excel worksheet just got to complicated so I<br>made this web app. </p>
<p>It is built using <a href="https://smartclient.com/">Smartclient</a> for the interface and<br>is served by CouchDB where the data is stored as a couchapp. At the moment it<br>sits on a Linode server. Users are authenticated and can be assigned roles. The<br>user database is synced between databases. I wrote a long spiel about the<br>security aspects of the app <a href="http://roster_help.axion5.net/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The app can be run offline because it uses application cache. The app itself can<br>be synced to a local database, and so can the data the app runs against. The app<br>can also be run against an in-browser database using an implemention of a<br>browser version of CouchDB: <a href="http://pouchdb.com/">pouchdb</a>. </p>
<p>I tried to keep the UI as simple as possible, no menus, only 5 little<br>buttons. The user can build up their own UI to some extent by dragging and<br>dropping, this gets persisted accross sessions, and even accross databases. </p>
<p>The thing is designed really to be backend agnostic and extendable by plugin<br>views, even plugin types. But at the moment it works against CouchDB and has only<br>the following types (and their editors): shift, location, person, settings,<br>user and the following views of data: table, calendar and time sheet. The design<br>of the app is such that it is quite easy to add more views of the data, like a<br>graph for instance. </p>
<p>From the repo’s README:</p>
<p>{% blockquote %}<br>To help people set up a CouchDB instance I wrote quilt, it configures and sets up all the necessary replications for them. It is also a generic CouchDB manager a la futon.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a decentralized but hierarchical group of CouchDB instances against which the app can work, see my blurb on security.</p>
<p>In the end staff can view their upcoming shifts online, bosses can manipulate them, and management can have an overview and collate all the data easily.</p>
<p>SmartClient is a bit cumbersome and it would be nice to rewrite the app using no<br>frameworks. Especially the calendar gets a bit sluggish.<br>{% endblockquote %}</p>
<p>The app itself is used by a few people at the organisation I wrote it for. I had<br>a meeting/presentation with management, but things can move a bit slow at these<br>organizations. Or maybe I am just not the best salesman..</p>

<h3 id="bootstrapjs"><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/bootstrapjs">bootstrapjs</a></h3>
<p>To keep the roster app modular I wrote my version of requirejs. Not AMD<br>compatible, but same idea and functionality. See the repo for more info. I had<br>ideas of having it concatenate all the files in the right order for production<br>use. However browserify and the use of transpiled languages (clojure!) make it<br>all this a bit obsolete. Let alone that javascript itself will have modules in<br>es6 it seems. But it was fun to write, basically doing a depth first search to<br>resolve the dependencies, with detection of cyclic dependencies.</p>
