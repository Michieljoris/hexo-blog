<p><br/><br>I am a developer, not a designer, however I try to make a site look as pleasing<br>as possible. My starting point is a template, which I tweak and adapt till it<br>comes accross as some kind of unit, the exception so far has been the greenglass<br>site, which is actually bit more of a one page app then a traditional website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.julangart.com">www.julangart.com</a><br>{% img right /images/julangart.jpg  julangart.com %}<br>Built with Drupal and hosted very cheaply at<br><a href="http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net">nearlyfreespeech</a>. The end user can build<br>their own galleries and add them to the site. Fully responsive, so mobile ready.</p>

<p>Built with angularjs and bootstrap and running off a<br><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/bb-server">home spun</a> nodejs server. The site<br>is built out of html fragments put together by my<br><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/html-builder">html-builder</a>. Mobile<br>ready. Served from nodejitsu originally, but now from a Linode server. End user<br>is able to edit the main texts by using my<br><a href="http://dbeditor.axion5.net/">dropbox editor</a>, and then visiting the sync page<br>on their site. The site automatically rebuilds itself after. Similarly the end<br>user can edit a list of videos. They get grouped automatically and listed on the<br>resources page. A bit similar to a blogging engine. In fact, using the same<br>mechanism the site can easily be expanded to enable dynamic adding/editing of<br>content, using an online editor. However, that is not implemented yet.</p>

<p>A true one page app using angularjs and nodejs. The idea was to make a site that<br>resembles a gallery as closely as possible. You can make a selection of the kind<br>of terrarium by clicking the select button. The site uses<br><a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">isotope</a> for the auto rearranging images. End<br>user is able to upload images from an ipad to dropbox. By visiting the sync page<br>the server pulls these images from there. The end user is then able to add tags<br>such as price and size to all images. The end user has to log into the site to<br>enable the editing features. The server is again my own<br><a href="https://github.com/Michieljoris/bb-server">bb-server</a>), running on <a href="">AWS</a> at the<br>moment but will migrate to a Linode server.</p>
